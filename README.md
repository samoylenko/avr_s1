Simple miniature DIY project (toy for my son) using 4 LEDs and ATTiny85

Notes:
  * Uses interrupts and timers instead of delays
  * Optimizes power consumption
  * My first C project in the MCU world (I prefer Assembly)

TODO in the next project:
  * Start using 'power-down' mode to preserve even more power
  * Try to add a [Joule thief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule_thief) or something similar
